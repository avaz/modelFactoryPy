# modelFactoryPy
Python package for Model Factory created by Advanced Analytics team at KPN.

**How to get started with your own ModelFactory:**

1) First of all, create MODELFACTORY environmental variable.

   On Windows it can be tricky, you need to do the following:
   
      -add a system environment variable MODELFACTORY with value of folder of your choice, for example: C:\Projects;
      
      -add the following line to PATH system environment variable: %MODELFACTORY%\bin;
      
      -in command line call echo %MODELFACTORY% -> this should return the specified path
